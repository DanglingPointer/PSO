## PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm implemented in C++ for discrete parameter values read in from a text file. Objective and constraint functions are to be written by user.

The file `partswarmopt.h` is one of my first experiments using C++. It is very simple and doesn't always function properly. The function calculating Inertia weight is a stub.

The second implementation is more advanced and will supposedly perform better. It can found in the file `pso.h` which is not finished yet. Among other things, constraint function and inertia weight approaches are to be chosen and implemented.
